lab3b.py parses csv file from EXT2 file system and audits the report for
any errors. At first we had trouble getting used to python and the libraries
but we eventually found that it was so much simpler and easier than C.
The argparse and opening the file was pretty straight forward. We made
classes for each of the objects like Inodes, SuperBlock, block, so on.
We made lists for freeBlocks, Inodes, Blocks, and freeInodes, which made a
lot of the code easy to write.

Makefile generates a tarball, cleans directory, and builds
